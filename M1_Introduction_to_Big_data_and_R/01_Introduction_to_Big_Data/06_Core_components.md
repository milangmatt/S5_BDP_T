## 1. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

*   **Distributed Storage**: HDFS is a distributed storage system that allows data to be stored across multiple machines in a cluster.
*   **Scalability**: HDFS provides a scalable way to store large amounts of data.
*   **Fault-Tolerance**: HDFS is designed to be fault-tolerant, ensuring that data is always available even in the event of hardware failures.

HDFS is the primary storage system used by Hadoop applications. It provides a reliable and efficient way to store and retrieve large datasets.

## 2. MapReduce

*   **Programming Model**: MapReduce is a programming model used for processing large data sets in parallel across a cluster of computers.
*   **Mapper**: The mapper is responsible for processing input data and producing output in the form of key-value pairs.
*   **Reducer**: The reducer is responsible for aggregating the output from the mapper and producing the final output.

MapReduce is a fundamental component of the Hadoop ecosystem, providing a flexible and scalable way to process large datasets.

## 3. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)

*   **Resource Management**: YARN is a resource management layer that manages resources and schedules jobs (applications) on the Hadoop cluster.
*   **Job Scheduling**: YARN provides a flexible and scalable way to schedule jobs on the Hadoop cluster.
