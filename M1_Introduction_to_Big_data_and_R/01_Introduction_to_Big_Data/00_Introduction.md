# Big Data

## Introduction

Big Data refers to the vast amounts of structured and unstructured data that organizations and businesses generate and collect on a daily basis. This data can come from various sources, including *social media, IoT devices, sensors*, and more. The sheer *volume, velocity, and variety* of this data make it difficult to process and analyze using traditional data processing tools.

Big Data is related to extracting meaningful data by analyzing the huge amount of complex, variously formatted data generated at high speed, that cannot be handled, or processed by the traditional system.

## What is Big Data?

Big Data is characterized by the 5 Vs:

* **Volume**: The large amount of data generated and collected every day.
* **Velocity**: The speed at which data is generated and processed.
* **Variety**: The different types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
* **Veracity**: The accuracy and quality of the data.
* **Value**: The insights and knowledge that can be gained from analyzing the data.
