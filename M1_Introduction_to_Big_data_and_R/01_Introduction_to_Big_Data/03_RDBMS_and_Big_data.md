# RDBMS VS Hadoop

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and Hadoop are two popular technologies used for data storage and processing. In this document, we will introduce both technologies, highlight their similarities, and provide a comparison table to illustrate their differences.

## Introduction to RDBMS

A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of database management system that stores data in a structured format using tables, rows, and columns. RDBMS uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and manipulate data. Examples of popular RDBMS include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## Introduction to Hadoop

Hadoop is an open-source, distributed computing framework that is used for storing and processing large datasets. It is designed to handle massive amounts of data and provides a scalable and fault-tolerant architecture. Hadoop is widely used for big data analytics, data warehousing, and data integration.

## Similarities between RDBMS and Hadoop

* Both RDBMS and Hadoop are used for data storage and processing.
* Both support data querying and analysis.
* Both provide data security and access control features.
* Both are widely used in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.

## Comparison Table: RDBMS vs Hadoop

| RDBMS | Hadoop |
| --- | --- |
| Structured data in tables | Unstructured or semi-structured data in files |
| SQL queries | MapReduce, Spark, or other processing frameworks |
| Vertical scaling (increase power of a single node) | Horizontal scaling (add more nodes to the cluster) |
| Suitable for small to medium-sized datasets | Designed for large-scale datasets |
| Supports various data types, including integers, strings, and dates | Supports various data formats, including CSV, JSON, and Avro |
| Yes, supports atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability | No, does not support ACID compliance |
| Fast data retrieval using indexes and caching | Slow data retrieval due to disk I/O operations |
| Can be expensive, especially for large-scale deployments | Open-source and cost-effective |
|It is best suited for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) environment|It is best suited for BIG data.|
| Supports various data modeling techniques, including normalization and denormalization | Supports various data processing techniques, including batch processing and real-time processing |
| Supports various data integration tools, including ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | Supports various data integration tools, including data ingestion and data streaming |
|The data schema of RDBMS is static type. |The data schema of Hadoop is dynamic type.|
|The data of RDBMS is stored in a single machine / file / table / database . |The data of Hadoop is stored in a distributed environment or multiple files / tables / databases .|
|High Data Integrity|Low Data Integrity|
|High Data Consistency|Low Data Consistency|


Hadoop provides a powerful mechanism for data analytics, which consists of the following:


* **Massive Storage Capacity** : Hadoop enables applications to handle enormous amounts of data by leveraging clusters of thousands of machines, providing a cost-effective solution for high-performance computing applications that were previously only possible with supercomputers. This allows enterprises to affordably store and process vast amounts of data.

* **Efficient Distributed Processing** : Hadoop clusters offer fast data access and efficient storage of large datasets. By moving execution closer to the data, Hadoop overcomes the challenges of parallel computation applications that struggled with distributing execution across machines. This approach alleviates high-performance challenges and provides fast data access.

* **Reliability, Failover, and Scalability** : Hadoop's design and implementation ensure that failures in large clusters do not result in inconsistent results. Hadoop detects failures, retries execution using different nodes, and allows for seamless addition of new servers to the cluster, providing both data storage and execution capabilities. The key benefit of Hadoop is its ability to separate business programming from infrastructure support, hiding infrastructure complexity and providing an easy-to-use platform for complex, distributed computations.


## Examples
Hadoop is widely used in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. Some examples are :

* **Data Warehousing**: Hadoop can be used to build large-scale data warehouses, allowing companies to store and analyze vast amounts of data from various sources, such as customer transactions, social media, and sensor data.
* **Recommendation Systems**: Hadoop can be used to build recommendation systems that analyze user behavior and preferences to suggest personalized products or services, such as those used by online retailers like Amazon.
* **Fraud Detection**: Hadoop can be used to detect fraudulent activities, such as credit card transactions or insurance claims, by analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns and anomalies.
* **Social Media Analytics**: Hadoop can be used to analyze large amounts of social media data, such as tweets or Facebook posts, to gain insights into public opinion and sentiment.
* **IoT Data Processing**: Hadoop can be used to process and analyze large amounts of data generated by IoT devices, such as sensors and smart home devices, to gain insights into usage patterns and optimize performance.
* **Genomics Research**: Hadoop can be used to analyze large amounts of genomic data, such as DNA sequences, to identify patterns and correlations that can lead to new medical treatments and discoveries.
* **Customer Segmentation**: Hadoop can be used to segment customers based on their behavior, preferences, and demographics, allowing companies to tailor their marketing efforts and improve customer engagement.
* **Supply Chain Optimization**: Hadoop can be used to optimize supply chain operations by analyzing large amounts of data on inventory levels, shipping routes, and supplier performance.


In conclusion, RDBMS and Hadoop are two different technologies used for data storage and processing.
