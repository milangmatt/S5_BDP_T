Reading and Writing Files in R
=====================================

### Overview
This tutorial will cover how to read and write files in R. We will cover the basics of reading and writing text files, CSV files, and Excel files.

### Reading

R provides several functions to read files, including:

* `read.csv()`: reads a comma-separated values file
* `read.table()`: reads a table from a file
* `readLines()`: reads a file line by line

Example: Reading a CSV file
```r
# Create a sample CSV file
write.csv(mtcars, "mtcars.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Read the CSV file
data <- read.csv("mtcars.csv")
print(data)
```

Output:
```
                     mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
1  Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
2  Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
3  Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
...
```

### Writing

R provides several functions to write files, including:

* `write.csv()`: writes a data frame to a comma-separated values file
* `write.table()`: writes a data frame to a table file
* `writeLines()`: writes a character vector to a file

Example: Writing a data frame to a CSV file
```r
# Create a sample data frame
data <- data.frame(name = c("John", "Mary", "David"), age = c(25, 31, 42))

# Write the data frame to a CSV file
write.csv(data, "people.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

### Manipulating Files and Directories

R provides several functions to manipulate files and directories, including:

* `file.create()`: creates a new file
* `file.remove()`: removes a file
* `dir.create()`: creates a new directory
* `dir.remove()`: removes a directory

Example: Creating a new directory
```r
# Create a new directory
dir.create("my_directory")
```

### Checking File Existence

R provides the `file.exists()` function to check if a file exists.

Example: Checking if a file exists
```r
# Check if a file exists
file.exists("mtcars.csv")
```

Output:
```
[1] TRUE
```

### Working with File Paths

R provides the `file.path()` function to work with file paths.

Example: Creating a file path
```r
# Create a file path
file_path <- file.path("my_directory", "my_file.txt")
print(file_path)
```

Output:
```
[1] "my_directory/my_file.txt"
```

### Reading and Writing Binary Files

R provides the `readBin()` and `writeBin()` functions to read and write binary files.

Example: Writing a binary file
```r
# Create a sample binary data
data <- as.raw(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

# Write the binary data to a file
writeBin(data, "binary_file.bin")
```

### Compression and Archiving

R provides the `zip()` and `unzip()` functions to compress and uncompress files.

Example: Compressing a file
```r
# Compress a file
zip("compressed_file.zip", "mtcars.csv")
```

### File Character Encoding

R provides the `iconv()` function to convert file character encoding.

Example: Converting file character encoding
```r
# Convert file character encoding
iconv("mtcars.csv", from = "UTF-8", to = "Latin1")
```
