## R Basic Syntax
R programming language is case sensitive. It uses parentheses to enclose the arguments of a function. This means that R treats uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct characters, and it requires parentheses to group arguments in a function call.

### Example
```r
# This is a comment in R
print("Hello, World!")
```
Output:
```
[1] "Hello, World!"
```
In this example, `print()` is a function that prints its argument to the console. The argument `"Hello, World!"` is a string that is enclosed in double quotes.

## R Print Output
The `print()` function is used to print output to the console. This function is useful for displaying the results of calculations or the values of variables.

### Example
```r
x <- "Hello, World!"
print(x)
```
Output:
```
[1] "Hello, World!"
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned the value `"Hello, World!"`. The `print()` function is then used to display the value of `x`.

### Other Print Functions

In addition to `print()`, R has several other functions that can be used to print output to the console. These include:

* `cat()`: This function is similar to `print()`, but it does not add quotes around character strings or add a newline at the end of the output.
```r
x <- "Hello, World!"
cat(x, "\n")
```
Output:
```
Hello, World!
```
* `message()`: This function is used to print messages to the console, and is often used for debugging purposes.
```r
x <- "Hello, World!"
message(x)
```
Output:
```
Hello, World!
```
* `warning()`: This function is used to print warning messages to the console.
```r
x <- "Hello, World!"
warning(x)
```
Output:
```
Warning message:
Hello, World!
```
* `stop()`: This function is used to print error messages to the console and stop the execution of the program.
```r
x <- "Hello, World!"
stop(x)
```
Output:
```
Error: Hello, World!
```
Note that these functions can be used in different contexts and have different effects on the output.


## R Comments
Comments in R start with the `#` symbol. Comments are used to add notes or explanations to code, and they are ignored by the R interpreter.

### Single Line Comment
```r
# This is a single line comment
```
This type of comment is used to add a note or explanation to a single line of code.

 R does not support multiline comments in the classical sense. However, you can use a workaround by starting each line of the comment with the `#` symbol.

## R Variables


### Print or Output Variables
```r
x <- "Hello, World!"
print(x)
```
Output:
```
[1] "Hello, World!"
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned the value `"Hello, World!"`. The `print()` function is then used to display the value of `x`.

## R Data Types
R has several data types, including numeric, integer, complex, character, and logical.

### Basic Data Types
#### Numeric
Numeric data types are used to represent numbers. They can be integers or decimals.

```r
x <- 10
print(class(x))
```
Output:
```
[1] "numeric"
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned the value `10`, which is a numeric value.

#### Integer
Integer data types are used to represent whole numbers. They are a subset of numeric data types.

```r
x <- 10L
print(class(x))
```
Output:
```
[1] "integer"
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned the value `10L`, which is an integer value.

#### Complex
Complex data types are used to represent complex numbers. They have both real and imaginary parts.

```r
x <- 10 + 5i
print(class(x))
```
Output:
```
[1] "complex"
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned the value `10 + 5i`, which is a complex number.

#### Character
Character data types are used to represent strings. They are enclosed in double quotes.

```r
x <- "Hello, World!"
print(class(x))
```
Output:
```
[1] "character"
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned the value `"Hello, World!"`, which is a character string.

#### Logical
Logical data types are used to represent true or false values.

```r
x <- TRUE
print(class(x))
```
Output:
```
[1] "logical"
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned the value `TRUE`, which is a logical value.

### Class Function
The `class()` function is used to determine the data type of a variable.

```r
x <- 10
print(class(x))
```
Output:
```
[1] "numeric"
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned the value `10`, and the `class()` function is used to determine its data type.

## R Numbers
R supports various numeric operations, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.

### Example
```r
x <- 10
y <- 5
print(x + y)
```
Output:
```
[1] 15
```
In this example, `x` and `y` are variables that are assigned numeric values, and the `+` operator is used to add them together.

### Type Conversion
R supports type conversion, which is the process of changing the data type of a variable.

```r
# Convert a numeric value to an integer
x <- 10.5
x <- as.integer(x)
print(class(x))

# Convert a numeric value to a character string
x <- 10
x <- as.character(x)
print(class(x))

# Convert a character string to a numeric value
x <- "10"
x <- as.numeric(x)
print(class(x))

# Convert a logical value to a numeric value
x <- TRUE
x <- as.numeric(x)
print(class(x))
print(class(x))
```



## R Math
R has various mathematical functions, including trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions.

### Example
```r
x <- 10
y <- 5
print(sin(x))
print(cos(y))
```
Output:
```
[1] -0.5440211
[1] 0.2836622
```


### R Math Functions
R has various mathematical functions, including sqrt, abs, ceiling, and floor.

#### Example
```r
x <- 10
y <- -5

# Calculate the square root of x
print(sqrt(x))

# Calculate the absolute value of y
print(abs(y))

# Calculate the ceiling of x
print(ceiling(x))

# Calculate the floor of x
print(floor(x))
```
Output:
```r
[1] 3.162278
[1] 5
[1] 10
[1] 10
```
In this example, `x` and `y` are variables that are assigned numeric values, and the `sqrt()`, `abs()`, `ceiling()`, and `floor()` functions are used to calculate their square root, absolute value, ceiling, and floor, respectively.

### sqrt() Function
The `sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of a number.

```r
x <- 16
print(sqrt(x))
```
Output:
```r
[1] 4
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned a numeric value, and the `sqrt()` function is used to calculate its square root.

### abs() Function
The `abs()` function is used to calculate the absolute value of a number.

```r
x <- -10
print(abs(x))
```
Output:
```r
[1] 10
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned a numeric value, and the `abs()` function is used to calculate its absolute value.

### ceiling() Function
The `ceiling()` function is used to calculate the ceiling of a number.

```r
x <- 10.5
print(ceiling(x))
```
Output:
```r
[1] 11
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned a numeric value, and the `ceiling()` function is used to calculate its ceiling.

### floor() Function
The `floor()` function is used to calculate the floor of a number.

```r
x <- 10.5
print(floor(x))
```
Output:
```r
[1] 10
```

## R Strings

R strings are used to represent character data. They are enclosed in double quotes.

### Example Functions

#### str_length()
The `str_length()` function returns the length of a character string.

```r
x <- "Hello, World!"
print(str_length(x))
```

Output:
```
[1] 13
```

#### str_concat()
The `str_concat()` function concatenates two or more character strings.

```r
x <- "Hello, "
y <- "World!"
print(str_concat(x, y))
```

Output:
```
[1] "Hello, World!"
```

#### str_contains()
The `str_contains()` function checks if a character string contains a specific substring.

```r
x <- "Hello, World!"
y <- "World"
print(str_contains(x, y))
```

Output:
```
[1] TRUE
```

#### tolower()
The `tolower()` function converts a character string to lowercase.

```r
x <- "HELLO, WORLD!"
print(tolower(x))
```

Output:
```
[1] "hello, world!"
```

#### toupper()
The `toupper()` function converts a character string to uppercase.

```r
x <- "hello, world!"
print(toupper(x))
```

Output:
```
[1] "HELLO, WORLD!"
```

#### substr()
The `substr()` function extracts a substring from a character string.

```r
x <- "Hello, World!"
print(substr(x, 1, 5))
```

Output:
```
[1] "Hello"
```

#### strsplit()
The `strsplit()` function splits a character string into substrings.

```r
x <- "apple,banana,cherry"
print(strsplit(x, ","))
```

Output:
```
[[1]]
[1] "apple"   "banana"  "cherry"
```

Output:
```
[[1]]
[1] "apple"   "banana"  "cherry"
```print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

### Escape Sequences
Escape sequences are used to represent special characters in a string. Here are a few examples:

| Escape Sequence | Description |
| --- | --- |
| \n | Newline |
| \t | Tab |
| \b | Backspace |
| \r | Carriage return |
| \f | Form feed |
| \a | Bell |
| \v | Vertical tab |
| \\ | Backslash |
| \\" | Double quote |
| \\' | Single quote |



## R Booleans
R supports boolean operations, including logical AND, OR, and NOT.

### Example
```r
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE
print(x & y)
```
Output:
```r
[1] FALSE
```


## R Logicals

R logicals are a data type that can have one of two values: TRUE or FALSE. They are used to represent boolean values and are often used in conditional statements and logical operations.

### Creating Logical Values

Logical values can be created using the TRUE and FALSE keywords.

```r
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE
```

### Logical Operations

R supports several logical operations, including:

* `&` (and)
* `|` (or)
* `!` (not)

These operations can be used to combine logical values.

```r
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE

print(x & y)  # FALSE
print(x | y)  # TRUE
print(!x)     # FALSE
```

### Conditional Statements

Logical values are often used in conditional statements, such as if-else statements.

```r
x <- 10
if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5")
} else {
  print("x is less than or equal to 5")
}
```

### Logical Functions

R has several built-in functions that operate on logical values, including:

* `all()`: returns TRUE if all elements of a vector are TRUE
* `any()`: returns TRUE if any element of a vector is TRUE
* `which()`: returns the indices of the elements of a vector that are TRUE

```r
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
print(all(x))  # FALSE
print(any(x))  # TRUE
print(which(x))  # 1 3
```r
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
print(all(x))  # FALSE
print(any(x))  # TRUE
print(which(x))  # 1 3
```



## R Assignments
R supports various assignment operators, including the left arrow `<-`, right arrow `->`, and equals `=`.

### Example

```r
x <- 10
y -> 20
z = 30

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

Output:
```
[1] 10
[1] 20
[1] 30
```
In this example, `x`, `y`, and `z` are variables that are assigned numeric values using different assignment operators.

### Left Arrow `<-`
The left arrow `<-` is the most commonly used assignment operator in R.

```r
x <- 10
print(x)
```
Output:
```
[1] 10
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned a numeric value using the left arrow `<-`.

### Right Arrow `->`
The right arrow `->` is used to assign a value to a variable, but it is less commonly used than the left arrow `<-`.

```r
y -> 20
print(y)
```
Output:
```
[1] 20
```
In this example, `y` is a variable that is assigned a numeric value using the right arrow `->`.

### Equals `=`
The equals `=` is also used to assign a value to a variable, but it is less commonly used than the left arrow `<-`.

```r
z = 30
print(z)
```
Output:
```
[1] 30
```
In this example, `z` is a variable that is assigned a numeric value using the equals `=`.
Output:
```
[1] 30
```
In this example, `z` is a variable that is assigned a numeric value using the equals `=`.

## R Operators
R supports various operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.

### Example
```r
x <- 10
y <- 5
print(x > y)
```
Output:
```R
[1] TRUE
```

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `+` | Addition | `x + y` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `x - y` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `x * y` |
| `/` | Division | `x / y` |
| `^` | Exponentiation | `x ^ y` |
| `%%` | Modulus | `x %% y` |
| `%/%` | Integer Division | `x %/% y` |

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `==` | Equal to | `x == y` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `x != y` |
| `>` | Greater than | `x > y` |
| `<` | Less than | `x < y` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `x >= y` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `x <= y` |

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `&` | Logical AND | `x & y` |
| `\|` | Logical OR | `x \| y` |
| `!` | Logical NOT | `!x` |

### Assignment Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<-` | Assignment | `x <- y` |
| `->` | Assignment | `x -> y` |
| `=` | Assignment | `x = y` |
| `<<-` | Global Assignment | `x <<- y` |



### Miscellaneous Operators


| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:` | Creates a sequence of numbers | `1:10` |
| `%in%` | Checks if an element belongs to a vector | `1 %in% c(1, 2, 3)` |
| `%*%` | Performs matrix multiplication | `matrix(1:4, nrow = 2) %*% matrix(5:8, nrow = 2)` |



## R Conditionals
R supports conditional statements, including if-else statements and switch statements.

### Example
```r
x <- 10
if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5")
}
```
Output:
```
[1] "x is greater than 5"
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned a numeric value, and an if-else statement is used to check whether it is greater than 5.


### If Else-if Else Tree

```r
x <- 10
if (x > 15) {
  print("x is greater than 15")
} else if (x > 10) {
  print("x is greater than 10 but less than or equal to 15")
} else if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than or equal to 5")
}
```
Output:
```r
[1] "x is greater than 10 but less than or equal to 15"
```

### AND and OR Operators in Conditionals

#### AND Operator ( & )

The AND operator ( & ) is used to check if two conditions are true. If both conditions are true, the result is true. Otherwise, the result is false.

### Example
```r
x <- 10
y <- 5
if (x > 5 & y < 10) {
  print("Both conditions are true")
}
```
Output:
```
[1] "Both conditions are true"
```
In this example, `x` and `y` are variables that are assigned numeric values, and an if statement is used to check if both conditions are true.

#### OR Operator ( | )

The OR operator ( | ) is used to check if at least one condition is true. If either condition is true, the result is true. Otherwise, the result is false.

### Example
```r
x <- 10
y <- 15
if (x > 5 | y < 10) {
  print("At least one condition is true")
}
```
Output:
```
[1] "At least one condition is true"
```
In this example, `x` and `y` are variables that are assigned numeric values, and an if statement is used to check if at least one condition is true.

Combining AND and OR Operators

You can combine the AND and OR operators to create more complex conditions.

### Example
```r
x <- 10
y <- 5
z <- 15
if ((x > 5 & y < 10) | z > 10) {
  print("The condition is true")
}
```
Output:
```r
[1] "The condition is true"
```
In this example, `x`, `y`, and `z` are variables that are assigned numeric values, and an if statement is used to check if the condition is true.

## R Loops
R supports loops, including for loops, while loops, and repeat loops.

### While Loop
```r
x <- 1
while (x <= 5) {
  print(x)
  x <- x + 1
}
```
Output:
```
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 5
```
In this example, `x` is a variable that is assigned a numeric value, and a while loop is used to iterate from 1 to 5.

### For Loop
```r
fruits <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for (fruit in fruits) {
  print(fruit)
}
```
Output:
```
[1] "apple"
[1] "banana"
[1] "cherry"
```
In this example, `fruits` is a vector that contains character strings, and a for loop is used to iterate over the vector.


### Break and Next

In R, `break` and `next` are two control flow statements that are used to control the flow of loops.

#### Break Statement

The `break` statement is used to terminate the execution of a loop prematurely. When a `break` statement is encountered, the loop is exited immediately, and the program continues executing the code after the loop.

#### Example
```r
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i == 5) {
    break
  }
  print(i)
}
```
Output:
```
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
```
In this example, the `break` statement is used to exit the loop when `i` reaches 5.

#### Next Statement

The `next` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. When a `next` statement is encountered, the current iteration is skipped, and the loop continues with the next iteration.

#### Example
```r
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i == 5) {
    next
  }
  print(i)
}
```
Output:
```
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 6
[1] 7
[1] 8
[1] 9
[1] 10
```
In this example, the `next` statement is used to skip the iteration when `i` reaches 5.

#### Using Break and Next Together

You can use `break` and `next` together to control the flow of a loop.

#### Example
```r
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i == 5) {
    next
  }
  if (i == 8) {
    break
  }
  print(i)
}
```
Output:
```
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 6
[1] 7
```
In this example, the `next` statement is used to skip the iteration when `i` reaches 5, and the `break` statement is used to exit the loop when `i` reaches 8.

## R Functions
R supports functions, which are reusable blocks of code that take arguments and return values.

### Example
```r
add <- function(x, y) {
  return(x + y)
}
print(add(10, 5))
```
Output:
```
[1] 15
```
In this example, `add` is a function that takes two numeric arguments and returns their sum.



### R Parameters
R functions can take parameters, which are values that are passed to the function when it is called.

### Example
```r
add <- function(x, y) {
  return(x + y)
}
print(add(10, 5))
```
Output:
```
[1] 15
```
In this example, `x` and `y` are parameters of the `add` function.

### R Default Parameters
R functions can also have default parameters, which are values that are used if no value is provided for a parameter when the function is called.

### Example
```r
add <- function(x, y = 5) {
  return(x + y)
}
print(add(10))
```
Output:
```
[1] 15
```
In this example, `y` is a default parameter of the `add` function, with a default value of 5.

### R Recursion
R functions can also be recursive, meaning that they can call themselves.

### Example
```r
factorial <- function(n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return(1)
  } else {
    return(n * factorial(n - 1))
  }
}
print(factorial(5))
```
Output:
```
[1] 120
```
In this example, the `factorial` function is recursive, meaning that it calls itself to calculate the factorial of a number.


## R Global Variables
R supports global variables, which are variables that are defined outside of functions and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

### Example
```r
x <- 10
f <- function() {
  x <<- 20
}
f()
print(x)
```
Output:
```
[1] 20
```
In this example, `x` is a global variable that is assigned a numeric value, and a function `f` is defined that modifies the value of `x`.
